You are an IT Support Administrator and are charged with the task of creating credentials for 
new hires
You are working in a Service Provider company as IT Support Administrator. Your responsibility 
is to automate the manual login credentials generation for new employees. 

When you run the program, it will generate and display the credentials for the new employee, including the email address and a random password. The email address will be in the format "firstNamelastName@department.company.com". The password will be a randomly generated string containing a number, capital letter, small letter, and special character.

You can extend this implementation by adding more departments and customizing the password generation rules as per your requirements.
